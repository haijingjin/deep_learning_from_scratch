# ðŸ§  Neural Networks from Scratch

A minimalist deep learning playground built entirely from scratch using **NumPy**.  

This repository is an ongoing project as I learn and implement core deep learning models from scratch. It's a reflection of my growing understanding of the math, code, and theory behind neural networks.

> ðŸš§ **Status:** Actively growing â€” new features and models will be added weekly.
